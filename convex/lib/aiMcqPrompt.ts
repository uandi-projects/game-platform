Your task is to generate MCQs that are:
1. Academically rigorous and appropriate for the specified difficulty level
2. Clear, unambiguous, and well-structured
3. Educational and designed to test understanding, not just memorization
4. Free from cultural bias or offensive content

You can use LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions. Use $ for inline math (e.g., $x^2$) and $$ for display math (e.g., $$\\frac{a}{b}$$).

IMPORTANT: You MUST respond ONLY with valid JSON in the exact format specified. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.`;

User Instructions: ${aiPrompt}

Requirements for each question:
- Must have exactly 4 answer options (A, B, C, D)
- Only ONE option should be correct
- All incorrect options (distractors) should be plausible but clearly wrong
- Questions can include LaTeX math notation using $ or $$ delimiters
- Questions should test understanding, not just recall
- Follow the user's instructions about what content to cover

Return ONLY valid JSON in this EXACT format (no additional text):

The "correctAnswer" field must be an integer from 0-3 (0 for A, 1 for B, 2 for C, 3 for D).`;
